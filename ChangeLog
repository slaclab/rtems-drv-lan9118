2008/1/18 (TS):
 - added 'drvUdpSock' - a simple driver to provide std. filesystem
   I/O over lanIpBasic/UDP 'sockets'.
2008/1/17 (TS):
 - renamed EtherHeader -> EthHeader; there was a name conflict with
   SPEAR software / the AMD pcnet32 driver for which I wanted to add
   support.
 - added support for AMD 79c97x chips (PMC card which is handy; the
   ultimate goal is using udpComm for a GDB connection.
 - FIXED: endian-ness bug: IP checksums must not be converted to network
   byte-order.
2007/10/4 (TS):
 - udpSockSend() return value was inconsistent with BSD semantics
   (thanks to Stephen Norum) because it also counted the header bytes.
2007/9/6 (TS):
 - eliminated 'sd' argument from udpCommReturnPacket().
