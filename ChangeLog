2008/10/29 (TS): Fix problems reported by Stephen Norum (beatnik)
 - TX ring was apparently exhausted (send returning -ENOSPC). This
   occurred due to corruption because the driver task swiped the TX
   ring w/o acquiring the lock.
 - After re-plugging cable the port seemed to be dead. Need to
   propagate link change to serial port; use new MVE driver entry
   point BSP_mve_ack_link_chg() for this purpose.
2007/9/6 (TS):
 - eliminated 'sd' argument from udpCommReturnPacket().
